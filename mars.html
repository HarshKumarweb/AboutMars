    <h2>About the Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury.<br> In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, and has a crust primarily composed<br> of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps.<br> It also has two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.

Olympus Mons, the largest volcano<br> and highest known mountain on any Solar System planet, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System, are on Mars.<br> The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.<br>[19] The days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational<br> axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the<br> atmospheric pressure on Earth.[20][21] Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[22][23] Multiple lines of evidence suggest<br> that Mars was wetter in the distant past, and thus possibly more suited for life. However, whether life ever did exist there,<br> and if it could have survived to the present day, remain unanswered questions.

Mars has been explored by<br> several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. NASA's Viking 1 lander transmitted the first images from the Martian surface in 1976.<br> Two countries have successfully deployed rovers on Mars, the United States first doing so with Sojourner in 1997<br> and China with Zhurong in 2021.[24]

Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye,<br> as can its striking reddish coloring. This appearance, due the iron oxide prevalent on its surface,<br> has led to Mars often being called the Red Planet.[25][26] It is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude that reaches âˆ’2.94,<br> comparable to that of Jupiter and surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[14] Over the centuries, Mars has featured in culture and the arts<br> in ways that have reflected humanity's growing knowledge of it.</p>
